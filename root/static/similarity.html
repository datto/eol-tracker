                In the Linux world, everybody wants to make their own distribution.
                Usually, custom or esoteric distributions are based on one of the major distributions.
                This flowchart attempts to unravel what these lesser known distributions are under the hood.
                The three major distributions are: RHEL/CentOS, SuSE Enterprise, and Debian.
                Each of these have a quicker updating variant: Fedora, openSuSE, and Ubuntu, respectively.
                Typically, a lesser known distribution will be based on CentOS, the non-subscription based RHEL,
                especially (at the time of this writing) if the version starts with 6, 7, or 8.
            </p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <h5>Sangoma Linux 7</h5>
            <p>
                For a simple example, let's take Sangoma Linux 7.
                This variety is what FreePBX ships with.
                Starting with the first question, "Is the distribution explicitly listed in the timeline?"
                This one is pretty easy, it's not (and if it is, let's ignore it for the sake of the example), so we can
                move on to the next one, "Is one of the values of <samp>ID_LIKE</samp> in <samp>/etc/os-release</samp>
                explicitly listed in the timeline?"
                Looking at the file, we see:
<pre class="code-quote">NAME="Sangoma Linux"
VERSION="7 (Core)"
ID="sangoma"
ID_LIKE="centos rhel fedora"
VERSION_ID="7"
PRETTY_NAME="Sangoma Linux 7 (Core)"
...</pre>
                <samp>ID_LIKE</samp> has some names that look familiar.
                CentOS / RHEL should be the first shot.
                This also seems to line up with CentOS's and RHEL's versioning scheme.
                The CentOS 7 package would be the most similar.
                Sometimes, the <samp>ID</samp> field will not match the name of the distribution, but instead be the
                name of the distribution it's based on.
            </p>
            <h5>Photon OS 3</h5> 
            <p>
                This is VMware's distribution that is specialized to work with their products.
                Again, we'll assume this this not on the timeline.
                The contents of <samp>/etc/os-release</samp> don't help much.
<pre class="code-quote">NAME="VMware Photon OS"
VERSION="3.0"
ID="photon"
VERSION_ID=3.0
PRETTY_NAME="VMware Photon OS/Linux"
...</pre>
                However, the machine has <samp>rpm</samp> installed (for RPM packages, we'd be looking for
                <samp>dpkg</samp> for DEB packages).
                The kernel version (at the time of this writing) is 4.19.15, a little bit newer than RHEL 8's.
                The RHEL/CentOS package will most likely work the best.
            </p>
            <h5>Arch Linux</h5>
            <p>
                This is an example of a distribution that has no obvious relation to any others.
                The name probably is not on the list, and <samp>/etc/os-release</samp> provides nothing helpful.
<pre class="code-quote">NAME="Arch Linux"
ID=arch
PRETTY_NAME="Arch Linux"
...</pre>
                Looking at what package manager it uses, pacman, we can see that it uses it's own package format.
                This distro will probably take some work to explicitly support.
